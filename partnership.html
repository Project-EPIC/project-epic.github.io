		<p>Project EPIC has a strong record of publication. We have focused predominantly on venues related to HCI, CSCW and ISCRAM, but have also expanded into other specialist areas in different disciplines as the opportunities arise. Our lab is internally collaborative in its approach to research. While we are not actively seeking collaborations with external scholars, we welcome ideas for research enterprise from scholars with specific interest and ideas related to the work we do. Our dataset collections are held securely under the IRB protocol conditions and Terms of Service of the tools we access.</p>

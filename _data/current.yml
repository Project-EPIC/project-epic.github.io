  bio: 'Leysia Palen is Professor of Computer Science, and Professor and Founding
    Chair of the newly established Department of Information Science at the University
    of Colorado Boulder, USA. She is a leader in the area of crisis informatics, an
    area she forged with her graduate students and colleagues at Colorado. She brings
    her training in human-computer interaction (HCI), computer-supported cooperative
    work and social computing to bear on understanding and advancing socio-technical
    issues of societal import. She conducts empirical research in the interpretivist
    tradition. However, in the advancing arena of large-scale on-line interaction
    (the "big data" of crisis response), she adapts quantitative techniques that then
    allow the application of qualitative methods and the "ethnographic eye" to closely
    observe and describe social structures in such technology-mediated situations.
    For this work, Prof. Palen has been recently given the 2015 ACM Computer Human
    Interaction Social Impact Award. '

    at the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is Co-Director of the Center for
    Software and Society and leads that Center's Big Data Initiative. He also co-directs
    Project EPIC, a $4M NSF grant that investigates how members of the public make
    use of social media during times of mass emergency. Professor Anderson leads the
    design and implementation of a large-scale data collection and analytics system
    for that project.

  bio: 'Gloria Mark''s research interest is in what is known as social computing:
    studying how individuals, groups, society and technology mutually influence each
    other. She is particularly interested in studying how technology use affects attention,
    mood, and above all, stress. For this she uses a system she calls precision tracking,
    which involves a combination of sensors, bio-sensors, experience sampling, surveys,
    and ethnographic techniques to gain a very detailed, comprehensive, and in-depth
    understanding of what people experience when they use computer systems. She studies
    such behavior in the workplace and also with those in the Millennial Generation,
    to see how growing up with the Internet affects their experience. She also studies
    how people use social media and computer systems more generally to see how they
    can use such systems to be resilient during and after environmental crises.'

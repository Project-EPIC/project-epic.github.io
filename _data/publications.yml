  title: Working & Sustaining the Virtual “Disaster Desk”
  abstract: Humanity Road is a volunteer organization working within the domain of
    disaster response. The organization is entirely virtual, relying on ICT to both
    organize and execute its work of helping to inform the public on how to survive
    after disaster events. This paper follows the trajectory of Humanity Road from
    an emergent group to a formal non-profit, considering how its articulation, conduct
    and products of work together express its identity and purpose, which include
    aspirations of relating to and changing the larger ecosystem of emergency response.
    Through excerpts of its communications, we consider how the organization makes
    changes in order to sustain itself in rapid-response work supported in large part
    by episodic influxes of volunteers. This case enlightens discussion about technology-supported
    civic participation, and the means by which dedicated long-term commitment to
    the civic sphere is mobilized.

    Medical Twitterers During the 2010 Haiti Earthquake'
  etc: 2012 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Bellevue, WA.
  abstract: We examine the  public, social media communications of 110 emergency medical
    response teams and organizations in the immediate aftermath of the January 12,
    2010 Haiti earthquake. We  found  the teams through an inductive analysis of Twitter
    communications acquired over the three-week emergency period from 89,114 Twitterers.
    We then analyzed the teams’  Twitter streams, as well as all digital media they
    generated and pointed to in their streams—blog posts, photographs, videos, status
    updates and field reports—to understand the medical coordination challenges they
    faced from pre-deployment readiness to on the-ground action. Here we identify
    opportunities for improving coordination in a decentralized and distributed environment
    where staffing, disease trajectories, and other circumstances rapidly change.
    We extrapolate from these findings to theorize about how “beaconing” behavior
    is a sign of latent potential for coordination upon which mechanisms of coordination
    can capitalize.

  title: Blogs as a Collective War Diary.
  etc: Proceedings of CSCW’12, Seattle, WA.
  abstract: Disaster-related research in human-centered computing has typically focused
    on the shorter-term, emergency period of a disaster event, whereas effects of
    some crises are longterm, lasting years. Social media archived on the Internet
    provides researchers the opportunity to examine societal reactions to a disaster
    over time. In this paper we examine how blogs written during a protracted conflict
    might reflect a collective view of the event. The sheer amount of data originating
    from the Internet about a significant event poses a challenge to researchers;
    we employ topic modeling and pronoun analysis as methods to analyze such large-scale
    data. First, we discovered that blog war topics temporally tracked the actual,
    measurable violence in the society suggesting that blog content can be an indicator
    of the health or state of the affected population. We also found that people exhibited
    a collective identity when they blogged about war, as evidenced by a higher use
    of first person plural pronouns compared to blogging on other topics. Blogging
    about daily life decreased as violence in the society increased; when violence
    waned, there was a resurgence of daily life topics, potentially illustrating how
    a society returns to normalcy.

  etc: In Proceedings of the ACM 2012 conference on Computer Supported Cooperative
    Work (CSCW &#8217;12). ACM, New York, NY, USA, 17-26.
  abstract: In this paper we investigate the role blogs played within the context
    of the Egyptian revolution of early 2011 using blog data authored between 2004-2011.  We
    conducted topic modeling analysis to gain a longitudinal view of the interaction
    of societal, personal and revolutionary blog topics over this period. Furthermore,
    a qualitative  analysis of blog posts during the period that bracketed the political
    uprising revealed Egyptian bloggers’ concerns. Reporting events and supplying
    commentary provided bloggers with a means to voice dissent against  institutionalized
    power represented by  the  government-controlled media. In short, blogs reveal
    a counter-narrative to the government-supplied version of events in Egypt during
    the  18-day uprising. These narratives offer rich documentation of how blogs,
    and perhaps social media more generally, can be utilized by individuals operating
    under repressive conditions.

  title: ! 'The Evolving Role of the Public Information Officer: An Examination of

  etc: Journal of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. (2012)
  abstract: This work examines how the introduction of social media has affected the
    role of the Public Information Officer (PIO)—the public relations component of
    the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Through analysis of 25 PIO interviews,
    we examine the work practice of PIOs and find that social media expand not only
    the scope and type of PIO work activity, but also the “information pathways” that
    exist between PIOs, the media, and members of the public. We model these changes
    and examine how the presence of social media challenges previous conceptualizations
    of PIO work. Lastly, we present a view of how PIO work could be better imagined
    for the future of emergency management organizations.

  etc: Proceedings of CSCW 2012, Seattle, WA.
  abstract: This paper reports on an ethnographic study of Facebook use amongst a
    population living through ongoing disruption. We interviewed 45 Iraqi citizens,
    as well as received survey responses from 218 individuals, who have been experiencing
    the current Gulf War since March 2003. We show how people in a society experiencing
    conflict use Facebook in ways that are different to uses in non-war societies.
    We find that Facebook supports people living in crisis environments at two levels.
    First, Facebook aids people directly to recover from disruption. People used Facebook
    to create “safe lists”, to seek help and provide assistance, and to re-construct
    their social scaffolding. But at a deeper level, citizens also used Facebook to
    maintain and develop new social norms, and to re-direct their country. We discuss
    how disruption can serve as an opportunity by which people can re-invent their
    societies and how our understandings of Facebook should evolve.

    2011 Egyptian Uprising.'
  etc: 2012 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Bellevue, WA.
  abstract: This paper examines microblogging information diffusion activity during
    the 2011 Egyptian political uprisings. Specifically, we examine the use of the
    retweet mechanism on Twitter, using empirical evidence of information propagation
    to reveal aspects of  work that the crowd conducts. Analysis of the widespread
    contagion of a popular meme reveals interaction between those who were “on the
    ground” in Cairo and those who were not. However, differences between information
    that appeals to the larger crowd and those who were doing on-the-ground work reveal
    important interplay between the two realms. Through both qualitative and statistical
    description, we show how the crowd expresses solidarity and does the work of information
    processing through recommendation and filtering. We discuss how these aspects
    of work mutually sustain crowd interaction in a politically sensitive context.
    In addition, we show how features of this retweet recommendation behavior could
    be used in combination with other indicators to identify information that is new
    and likely coming from the ground.

    Response and Management (ISCRAM 2012), Vancouver, BC.
  abstract: Social media tools, including the microblogging platform Twitter, have
    been appropriated during mass disruption events by those affected as well as the
    digitally-convergent crowd. Though tweets sent by those local to an event could
    be a resource both for responders and those affected, most Twitter activity during
    mass disruption events is generated by the remote crowd. Tweets from the remote
    crowd can be seen as noise that must be filtered, but another perspective considers
    crowd activity as a filtering and recommendation mechanism. This paper tests the
    hypothesis that crowd behavior can serve as a collaborative filter for identifying
    people tweeting from the ground during a mass disruption event. We test two models
    for classifying on-the-ground Twitterers, finding that machine learning techniques
    using a Support Vector Machine with asymmetric soft margins can be effective in
    identifying those likely to be on the ground during a mass disruption event.

  abstract: In times of mass emergency, vast amounts of data are generated via computer-mediated
    communication (CMC) that are difficult to manually collect and organize into a
    coherent picture. Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful
    insight into time and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed efficiently
    and effectively. We describe a natural language processing component of the EPIC
    (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) Project infrastructure, designed
    to extract linguistic and behavioral information from tweet text to aid in the
    task of information integration. The system incorporates linguistic annotation,
    in the form of Named Entity Tagging, as well as behavioral annotations to capture
    tweets contributing to situational awareness and analyze the information type
    of the tweet content. We show classification results and describe future integration
    of these classifiers in the larger EPIC infrastructure.

  etc: ! 'In 2012 ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications:

  abstract: Software systems today seldom reside as isolated systems confined to generating
    and consuming their own data. Col- lecting, integrating and storing large amounts
    of data from disparate sources has become a need for many software engineers,
    as well as for scientists in research settings. This paper presents the lessons
    learned when transitioning a large-scale data collection infrastructure from a
    relational database to a hybrid persistence architecture that makes use of both
    relational and NoSQL technologies. Our examples are drawn from the software infrastructure
    we built to collect, store, and analyze vast numbers of status updates from the
    Twitter micro-blogging service in support of a large interdisciplinary group performing
    research in the area of crisis informatics. We present both the software architecture
    and data modeling challenges that we encountered dur- ing the transition as well
    as the benefits we gained having migrated to the hybrid persistence architecture.

  title: ! 'No Place Like Home: Pet-to-Family Reunification after Disaster'
  etc: Proceedings of the 2012 ACM annual conference extended abstracts on Human Factors
    in Computing Systems.
  abstract: Pets are important household members, and their welfare and safety are
    imperative to the emotional welfare of the family. Displacement of pets after
    disaster events is a serious matter to families and for public safety at large.
    People are not willing to evacuate without their non-human family members; many
    will break through evacuation zones to recover animals left behind. In the 2005
    Hurricane Katrina event, over 200,000 pets were displaced, and 95% of them were
    never reunited with their families. The US Department of Agriculture confirms
    that the problem of reuniting displaced pets and their guardians at this scale
    is unfortunately common in disaster events. We introduce No Place Like Home, a
    socially networked web and mobile platform that facilitates reunification of non-human
    with human family members following disaster events. No Place Like Home is an
    effort that supports the formation of small cadres of micro-tasking &#8216;digital
    volunteers&#8217; that converge after disasters to do photo- and description-matching;
    employs a reputation and reward system to encourage use; and uses match-based
    machine learning techniques to accelerate the manual matching tasks performed
    by digital volunteers.

  abstract: Crisis informatics is an emerging research area that studies how information
    and communication technology (ICT) is used in emergency response. An important
    branch of this area includes investigations of how members of the public make
    use of ICT to aid them during mass emergencies. Data collection and analytics
    during crisis events is a critical prerequisite for performing such research,
    as the data generated during these events on social media networks are ephemeral
    and easily lost. We report on the current state of a crisis informatics data analytics
    infrastructure that we are developing in support of a broader, interdisciplinary
    research program. We also comment on the role that software engineering research
    plays in these increasingly common, highly-interdisciplinary research efforts.

  abstract: ! 'The need for quick, timely and accurate information is critical in
    emergency events. People assemble information from both official and unofficial
    sources. As digital access expands, people will increasingly incorporate digital
    sources into decision-making and assess it against the local circumstances they
    experience. If we extrapolate to what such behavior means for the future, we argue
    that information management under emergency conditions will need to become increasingly
    socially distributed. A natural point of contention in such a view is the matter
    of how to assess the quality of information: how “good” or “bad” it is; whether
    it is “misinformation” or “disinformation.”  Borrowing from Simon’s satisficing,
    we consider the matter of the assessment of information helpfulness and credibility
    as a function of the “everyday analytic” skills that people use to take action
    during mass emergencies. We discuss steps in a research agenda for the development
    of analytical support tools.'

  abstract: In times of mass emergency, vast amounts of data are generated via computer-mediated

    picture. Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful insight
    into time- and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed properly and
    rapidly. We describe an approach for automatically identifying messages communicated
    via Twitter that contribute to situational awareness, and explain why it is beneficial
    for those seeking information during mass emergencies. We collected Twitter messages
    from four different crisis events of varying nature and magnitude and built a
    classifier to automatically detect messages that may contribute to situational
    awareness, utilizing a combination of hand- annotated and automatically-extracted
    linguistic features. Our system was able to achieve over 80% accuracy on categorizing
    tweets that contribute to situational awareness. Additionally, we show that a
    classifier developed for a specific emergency event performs well on similar events.
    The results are promising, and have the potential to aid the general public in
    culling and analyzing information communicated during times of mass emergency.

  abstract: When societies experience disruption as caused by natural disasters, various
    official government agencies, relief organizations, and emergent citizen groups
    engage in activities that aid in the recovery effort—the process that leads to
    the resumption of normal life. In war environments however, societal trust can
    be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated
    individuals that provide and resolve breakdowns in infrastructure. This paper
    reports on an ethnographic study of the use of ICTs by citizens experiencing ongoing
    disruption in a conflict zone. We conducted 86 interviews with Iraqi civilians
    who experienced the 2nd Gulf War beginning in March 2003. We show how citizens
    used ICTs to continuously resolve breakdowns in infrastructure during ongoing
    disruption caused by the conflict by creating new, reliable technology-mediated
    social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel,
    education and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure
    and implications for the disaster relief effort.

  abstract: This paper reports on an ethnographic study of the technology-enabled
    behavior that took place amongst a citizen population living in a conflict zone.
    We interviewed 65 Iraqi citizens who experienced the current Gulf War beginning
    in March 2003. In the context of a disrupted environment, trust in people and
    institutions can erode. We find that trust is contextual–-as aspects of the physical
    world change, conceptions of trust can also change. We show how people were able
    to create a context of trust in the environment by using ICTs to manage their
    public identity, to conduct background checks, and to develop collaborative practices
    that relied on those with whom interpersonal trust previously existed. These new
    practices, in turn, enabled people to maintain work collaborations, to determine
    whether or not to continue interacting with others in public, to be able to travel
    safely, and to find trustworthy jobs. In developing these new practices we argue
    that technology enabled people to restore a sense of normalcy in an environment
    that had radically changed.

    small features of the technical environment offered structure for self-organizing,
    while considering how the social-technical milieu enabled individual capacities
    and collective action. Using social theory about self organizing, the research
    offers insight about features of coordination within a setting of massive interaction.

  title: Policy Issues Facing the Use of Social Network Information During Times of
    Crisis.
  etc: The 38th Annual Telecommunications Policy Research Conference (TPRC) for Public
    Safety and Emergency session (October 1-3, 2010, Arlington, Virginia).
  abstract: The exchange of information during times of crisis/disaster has traditionally
    been the purview of public safety, the National Guard and other local, state or
    federal authorities.  However, this model is undergoing a change with the availability
    of new mobile communications capabilities and the rise of social networking sites.  The
    general public can now create and share information about crises as they unfold,
    and researchers have documented the timeliness and surprising accuracy of this
    information.  As part of a large National Science Foundation funded project, researchers
    at the University of Colorado are developing tools to extract, organize and assess
    the flow of crisis related information as posted on social networking sites.  With
    the promise of improved warning and coordination, such tools should help reduce
    the impacts of large-scale disruptions, including political crises, natural disasters,
    pandemics and terrorist threats.  In this model, members of the public can obtain
    (and produce) information about an emergency that is specialized to their needs—as
    well as meta-information specialized for crisis situations— that helps them make
    judgments about the ever-growing amount of information.  Such meta-information
    includes features of its source; judgments about the authoritativeness of the
    source; its concurrence (or not) with official sources; its timeliness (as the
    information may be better than official sources); other spatio-temporal features
    of the information’s life; and anticipation of who would be looking for this information
    and why. Data mining and information extraction techniques have a critical place
    here, as does the creation of trust models and security techniques to offer privacy
    or possibly anonymity. <br>However, if mechanisms are provided to enhance the
    users&#8217; privacy and even offer the capability for anonymous information contributions,
    it is possible that malicious entities may exploit this anonymity and inject false
    and misleading information into information streams. It is worth noting that false
    information could be introduced into the system without these features; it is
    just that an anonymizing system removes the consequence of being identified.  Fundamentally,
    establishing identity within a networked environment is a challenging problem.  For
    instance, a classic problem within the field of reputation systems is the Sybil
    attack, which occurs when a single entity establishes a large number of identities,
    for instance, by adding a large number of nodes to a peer-to-peer network.  This
    has implications on designing reputation systems to detect the injection of bad
    information by malicious parties, since it is always possible for them to simply
    add a new identity to the system to counteract any previous misbehavior.  Given
    this fact, we take an alternate approach to determining reputable users and information
    during an event.  We will look at two possible implicit reputation indicators,
    one using client location services and another using analysis methods based on
    network graphs and activity within networks.  Using network analysis methods,
    it may be possible to infer location, influence and other attributes based on
    communication, context and association with others in the network.  Data for these
    methods is available via public application programming interfaces (APIs) from
    some online social networks.  Monitoring these public APIs during crisis situations,
    we are able to use these analysis methods to infer information about users as
    the crisis is evolving.<br>With the development of these tools, we must consider
    public policy issues that arise from this research.  First, we ask what public
    policy issues emerge as a result of this vision of empirical research and development
    activities, and how they can be framed using a crisis informatics lens? Investigations
    of this kind require consideration about how crisis-related data is collected,
    analyzed and disseminated within the context of current federal and state laws,
    policies and regulations.  Because information aggregation efforts may cross national
    borders, we will also take into account similar (and often more stringent) laws
    and policies in other countries.  Important questions in this area center on issues
    of legal precedent, communications-related laws and policies, regulations and
    authorities regarding information dissemination during disasters and privacy and
    security issues.  Other questions include how the policy context will affect our
    own information capture and aggregation methods.  As an over-arching concern,
    we question whether it will be possible to design methods for capturing and processing
    diverse content ethically and in adherence of law, while also not creating new,
    insurmountable policy issues around information aggregation.  Next, we ask what
    is the risk of legal liabilities that might arise.  Who is responsible if the
    information is wrong?  What if the system suppresses the dissemination of vital
    information?  Does this constitute some type of negligence or a failure to adhere
    to required duty?

  abstract: On-line websites and applications are increasingly playing a role in disaster
    response and recovery. Yet with the wide variety of on-line grassroots activities
    that occur in such situations, it can be difficult to make sense of them. In this
    paper, we describe on-line behavior as socially convergent activity, interpreting
    it within existing sociological understandings of behavior in disaster events.
    We discuss seven types of convergent behavior and give examples of on-line activities
    for each type. By seeing these activities as an essential part of the disaster
    social arena, we can begin to think about how to support socially convergent phenomena
    in new and creative ways.

  abstract: The design and development of data-intensive software systems---systems
    that generate, collect, store, process, analyze, query, and visualize large sets
    of data---is fraught with significant challenges both technical and social. Project
    EPIC has been designing and developing data-intensive systems in support of crisis
    informatics research since Fall 2009. Our experience working on Project EPIC has
    provided insight into these challenges. In this paper, we share our experience
    working in this design space and describe the choices we made in tackling these
    challenges and their attendant trade-offs. We highlight the lack of developer
    support tools for data-intensive systems, the importance of multidisciplinary
    teams, the use of highly-iterative life cycles, the need for deep understanding
    of the frameworks and technologies used in data intensive systems, how simple
    operations transform into significant challenges at scale, and the paramount significance
    of data modeling in producing systems that are scalable, robust, and efficient.

  category: Data Collection and Analytics Infrastructure
  abstract: Crisis informatics investigates how society’s pervasive access to technology
    is transforming how it responds to mass emergency events. To study this transformation,
    researchers require access to large sets of data that because of their volume
    and heterogeneous nature are difficult to collect and analyze. To address this
    concern, we have designed and implemented an environment—EPIC Analyze— that supports
    researchers with the collection and analysis of social media data. Our research
    has identified the types of components—such as NoSQL, MapReduce, caching, and
    search—needed to ensure that these services are reliable, scalable, extensible,
    and efficient. We describe the design challenges encountered—such as data modeling,
    time vs. space tradeoffs, and the need for a useful and usable system—when building
    EPIC Analyze and discuss its scalability, performance, and functionality.

  title: 'Tweet Local, Retweet Global: Retweeting by the Geographically-Vulnerable
    during Hurricane Sandy'
  etc: ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing,
    pp. 981-993,
  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: Hurricane Sandy wrought $6 billion in damage, took 162 lives, and displaced
    776,000 people after hitting the US Eastern seaboard on October 29, 2012. Because
    of its massive impact, the hurricane also spurred a flurry of social media activity,
    both by the population immediately affected and by the globally convergent crowd.
    In this paper we explore how retweeting activity by the geographically vulnerable
    differs (if at all) from that of the general Twitter population. We investigate
    whether they spread information differently, including what and whose content
    they chose to propagate. We investigate whether the Twitter-based relationships
    are preexisting or if they are newly formed because of the disaster, and if so
    if they persist. We find that the people in the path of the disaster favor in
    their retweeting locally-created tweets and those with locally-actionable information.
    They also form denser networks of information propagation during disaster than
    before or after.

  title: 'Success & Scale in a Data-Producing Organization: The Socio-Technical Evolution
    of OpenStreetMap in Response to Humanitarian Events'
  etc: CHI 2015
  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a volunteer-driven, globally distributed organization
    whose members work to create a common digital map of the world. OSM embraces ideals
    of open data, and to that end innovates both socially and technically to develop
    practices and processes for coordinated operation. This paper provides a brief
    history of OSM and then, through quantitative and qualitative examination of the
    OSM database and other sites of articulation work, examines organizational growth
    through the lens of two catastrophes that spurred enormous humanitarian relief
    responses—the 2010 Haiti Earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Yolanda. The temporally-
    and geographically- constrained events scope analysis for what is a rapidly maturing,
    whole-planet operation. The first disaster identified how OSM could support other
    organizations responding to the event. However, to achieve this, OSM has had to
    refine mechanisms of collaboration around map creation, which were tested again
    in Typhoon Yolanda. The transformation of work between these two events yields
    insights into the organizational development of large, data-producing online organizations.

  category: Human-centered Software Engineering
  abstract: Human computation and crowdsourcing have become hot topics across several
    application domains. Indeed, some efforts have been directed toward emergency
    management to find ways to involve the public in disaster response. However, many
    tasks in disaster response can put the public in harm’s way or introduce problems
    of liability. Furthermore, some human computation tasks are disconnected from
    the true needs of emergency response. In this paper we discuss the case of an
    important lost-and-found task— reuniting displaced pets with their owners after
    a disaster. We argue why this task is a strong candidate for human computation
    by “digital volunteers.” The goal of this paper is to articulate the design decisions
    and software engineering problems faced in designing and developing a web-based
    crowdwork environment that supports a lost-and-found matching task.

  category: Data Collection and Analytics Infrastructure
  abstract: Web-based data analysis environments are powerful platforms for exploring
    large data sets. To ensure that these environments meet the needs of analysts,
    a human-centered perspective is needed. Interfaces to these platforms should provide
    flexible search, support usergenerated content, and enable collaboration. We report
    on our efforts to design and develop a web interface for a custom analytics platform—
    EPIC Analyze—which provides interactive search over large Twitter data sets collected
    during crisis events. We performed seven think-aloud sessions with researchers
    who regularly analyze crisis data sets and compiled their feedback. They identified
    a need for a “big picture” view of an event, flexible exporting capabilities,
    and user-defined coding schemes. Adding these features allowed EPIC Analyze to
    meet the needs of these analysts and enable exploratory research on crisis data.

  title: Incremental Sorting for Large Dynamic Data Sets
  etc: First IEEE International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Applications,
    pp. 170-175
  category: Data Collection and Analytics Infrastructure
  abstract: In today's world of pervasive computing, it is straightforward for organizations
    to generate large amounts of data in support of a variety of business needs. For
    this reason, it is important to build tools that allow analysts to manage and
    investigate these data sets quickly and efficiently. One feature needed by these
    tools is the ability to sort large amounts of data along a number of dimensions
    to facilitate the search for useful information. In this paper, we describe a
    new method for incrementally sorting large, multi-dimensional, dynamic data sets.
    Our particular use case involves sorting large Twitter data sets but our technique
    can be applied more generally across a variety of data types. Our approach is
    evaluated with respect to its scalability and by comparing it to several alternatives.
    It is currently able to efficiently sort data sets consisting of tens of millions
    of tweets along a variety of dimensions even when the data set is under active
    collection and new tweets are being added each day. The approach incrementally
    integrates the new tweets and provides sorted views of all tweets along various
    dimensions without having to re-sort the previously sorted tweets. The paper presents
    the benefits of the technique, discusses its limitations, and describes its software
    engineering contributions.

  abstract: 'The earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010 catalyzed a nascent
    set of efforts in then-emergent “volunteer technology communities.” Among these
    was the response from OpenStreetMap, a volunteer-driven project that makes geospatial
    data free and openly available. Following the earthquake, remotely located volunteers
    rapidly mapped the affected areas to support the aid effort in a remarkable display
    of crowdsourced work. However, some within that effort believed that the impact
    and import of open and collaborative mapping techniques could provide much richer
    value to humanitarian aid work and the long-term development needs of the country.
    They launched an ambitious project that trialed methods for how to create sustainable
    and locally-owned communitymapping ecosystems in at-risk regions of the world.
    This paper describes how an organization that emerged out of the response—the
    Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team—formalized their practices in relation to many
    different stakeholder needs with the aim for setting a model for how the potential
    of participatory, community mapping could be realized in Haiti and beyond. '

  category: Data Collection and Analytics Infrastructure, Perspectives and Vision
  abstract: Engineering reconnaissance following an extreme event is critical in identifying
    the causes of infrastructure failure and minimizing such consequences in similar
    future events. Typically, however, much of the data about infrastructure performance
    and the progression of geological phenomena are lost during the event or soon
    after as efforts move to the recovery phase. A better methodology for reliable
    and rapid collection of perishable hazards data will enhance scientific inquiry
    and accelerate the building of disaster-resilient cities. In this paper, we explore
    ways to support post-event reconnaissance through the strategic collection and
    reuse of social media data and other remote sources of information, in response
    to the September 2013 flooding in Colorado. We show how tweets, particularly with
    postings of visual data and references to location, may be used to directly support
    geotechnical experts by helping to digitally survey the affected region and to
    navigate optimal paths through the physical space in preparation for direct observation.

  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: Social media and other online communication tools are a subject of great
    interest in mass emergency response. Members of the public are turning to these
    solutions to seek and offer emergency information. Emergency responders are working
    to determine what social media policies should be in terms of their “public information”
    functions. We report on the online communications from all the coastal fire and
    police departments within a 100 mile radius of Hurricane Sandy’s US landfall.
    Across four types of online communication media, we collected data from 840 fire
    and police departments. Findings indicate that few departments used these online
    channels in their Sandy response efforts, and that communications differed between
    fire and police departments and across media type. However, among the highly engaged
    departments, there is evidence that they bend and adapt policies about what constitutes
    appropriate public communication in the face of emergency demands; therefore,
    we propose that flexibility is important in considering future emergency online
    communication policy. We conclude with design recommendations for making online
    communication media more “listenable” for both emergency managers and members
    of the public.

  abstract: Crisis informatics is a ﬁeld of research that investigates the use of
    computer-mediated communication---including social media---by members of the public
    and other entities during times of mass emergency. Supporting this type of research
    is challenging because large amounts of ephemeral event data can be generated
    very quickly and so must then be just as rapidly captured. Such data sets are
    challenging to analyze because of their heterogeneity and size. We have been designing,
    developing, and deploying software infrastructure to enable the large-scale collection
    and analysis of social media data during crisis events. We report on the challenges
    encountered when working in this space, the desired characteristics of such infrastructure,
    and the techniques, technology, and architectures that have been most useful in
    providing both scalability and ﬂexibility. We also discuss the types of analytics
    this infrastructure supports and implications for future crisis informatics research.

    an emergent group to a formal non-profit, considering how its articulation, conduct
    and products of work together express its identity and purpose, which include
    aspirations of relating to and changing the larger ecosystem of emergency response.
    Through excerpts of its communications, we consider how the organization makes
    changes in order to sustain itself in rapid-response work supported in large part
    by episodic influxes of volunteers. This case enlightens discussion about technology-supported

  abstract: We examine the  public, social media communications of 110 emergency medical

    communications acquired over the three-week emergency period from 89,114 Twitterers.
    We then analyzed the teams’  Twitter streams, as well as all digital media they
    generated and pointed to in their streams—blog posts, photographs, videos, status
    updates and field reports—to understand the medical coordination challenges they
    faced from pre-deployment readiness to on the-ground action. Here we identify
    opportunities for improving coordination in a decentralized and distributed environment
    where staffing, disease trajectories, and other circumstances rapidly change.
    We extrapolate from these findings to theorize about how “beaconing” behavior
    is a sign of latent potential for coordination upon which mechanisms of coordination
    can capitalize.

  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: Disaster-related research in human-centered computing has typically focused
    on the shorter-term, emergency period of a disaster event, whereas effects of
    some crises are longterm, lasting years. Social media archived on the Internet
    provides researchers the opportunity to examine societal reactions to a disaster
    over time. In this paper we examine how blogs written during a protracted conflict
    might reflect a collective view of the event. The sheer amount of data originating
    from the Internet about a significant event poses a challenge to researchers;
    we employ topic modeling and pronoun analysis as methods to analyze such large-scale
    data. First, we discovered that blog war topics temporally tracked the actual,
    measurable violence in the society suggesting that blog content can be an indicator
    of the health or state of the affected population. We also found that people exhibited
    a collective identity when they blogged about war, as evidenced by a higher use
    of first person plural pronouns compared to blogging on other topics. Blogging
    about daily life decreased as violence in the society increased; when violence
    waned, there was a resurgence of daily life topics, potentially illustrating how
    a society returns to normalcy.

    of societal, personal and revolutionary blog topics over this period. Furthermore,
    a qualitative  analysis of blog posts during the period that bracketed the political
    uprising revealed Egyptian bloggers’ concerns. Reporting events and supplying
    commentary provided bloggers with a means to voice dissent against  institutionalized
    power represented by  the  government-controlled media. In short, blogs reveal
    a counter-narrative to the government-supplied version of events in Egypt during
    the  18-day uprising. These narratives offer rich documentation of how blogs,
    and perhaps social media more generally, can be utilized by individuals operating
    under repressive conditions.

    conflict use Facebook in ways that are different to uses in non-war societies.
    We find that Facebook supports people living in crisis environments at two levels.
    First, Facebook aids people directly to recover from disruption. People used Facebook
    to create “safe lists”, to seek help and provide assistance, and to re-construct
    their social scaffolding. But at a deeper level, citizens also used Facebook to
    maintain and develop new social norms, and to re-direct their country. We discuss
    how disruption can serve as an opportunity by which people can re-invent their
    societies and how our understandings of Facebook should evolve.

  abstract: This paper examines microblogging information diffusion activity during
    the 2011 Egyptian political uprisings. Specifically, we examine the use of the
    retweet mechanism on Twitter, using empirical evidence of information propagation
    to reveal aspects of  work that the crowd conducts. Analysis of the widespread
    contagion of a popular meme reveals interaction between those who were “on the
    ground” in Cairo and those who were not. However, differences between information
    that appeals to the larger crowd and those who were doing on-the-ground work reveal
    important interplay between the two realms. Through both qualitative and statistical
    description, we show how the crowd expresses solidarity and does the work of information
    processing through recommendation and filtering. We discuss how these aspects
    of work mutually sustain crowd interaction in a politically sensitive context.
    In addition, we show how features of this retweet recommendation behavior could
    be used in combination with other indicators to identify information that is new
    and likely coming from the ground.

  abstract: Social media tools, including the microblogging platform Twitter, have
    been appropriated during mass disruption events by those affected as well as the
    digitally-convergent crowd. Though tweets sent by those local to an event could
    be a resource both for responders and those affected, most Twitter activity during
    mass disruption events is generated by the remote crowd. Tweets from the remote
    crowd can be seen as noise that must be filtered, but another perspective considers
    crowd activity as a filtering and recommendation mechanism. This paper tests the
    hypothesis that crowd behavior can serve as a collaborative filter for identifying
    people tweeting from the ground during a mass disruption event. We test two models
    for classifying on-the-ground Twitterers, finding that machine learning techniques
    using a Support Vector Machine with asymmetric soft margins can be effective in
    identifying those likely to be on the ground during a mass disruption event.

  abstract: In times of mass emergency, vast amounts of data are generated via computer-mediated

    coherent picture. Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful
    insight into time and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed efficiently
    and effectively. We describe a natural language processing component of the EPIC
    (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) Project infrastructure, designed
    to extract linguistic and behavioral information from tweet text to aid in the
    task of information integration. The system incorporates linguistic annotation,
    in the form of Named Entity Tagging, as well as behavioral annotations to capture
    tweets contributing to situational awareness and analyze the information type
    of the tweet content. We show classification results and describe future integration
    of these classifiers in the larger EPIC infrastructure.

  abstract: Software systems today seldom reside as isolated systems confined to generating
    and consuming their own data. Col- lecting, integrating and storing large amounts
    of data from disparate sources has become a need for many software engineers,
    as well as for scientists in research settings. This paper presents the lessons
    learned when transitioning a large-scale data collection infrastructure from a
    relational database to a hybrid persistence architecture that makes use of both
    relational and NoSQL technologies. Our examples are drawn from the software infrastructure
    we built to collect, store, and analyze vast numbers of status updates from the
    Twitter micro-blogging service in support of a large interdisciplinary group performing
    research in the area of crisis informatics. We present both the software architecture
    and data modeling challenges that we encountered dur- ing the transition as well
    as the benefits we gained having migrated to the hybrid persistence architecture.

  abstract: Pets are important household members, and their welfare and safety are
    imperative to the emotional welfare of the family. Displacement of pets after
    disaster events is a serious matter to families and for public safety at large.
    People are not willing to evacuate without their non-human family members; many
    will break through evacuation zones to recover animals left behind. In the 2005
    Hurricane Katrina event, over 200,000 pets were displaced, and 95% of them were
    never reunited with their families. The US Department of Agriculture confirms
    that the problem of reuniting displaced pets and their guardians at this scale
    is unfortunately common in disaster events. We introduce No Place Like Home, a
    socially networked web and mobile platform that facilitates reunification of non-human
    with human family members following disaster events. No Place Like Home is an
    effort that supports the formation of small cadres of micro-tasking &#8216;digital
    volunteers&#8217; that converge after disasters to do photo- and description-matching;
    employs a reputation and reward system to encourage use; and uses match-based
    machine learning techniques to accelerate the manual matching tasks performed
    by digital volunteers.

    of Microblogged Communications.'
  etc: University of Colorado at Boulder PhD Dissertation.
  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: "In times of mass emergency, users of Twitter (a popular microblogging
    service) often communicate information about the event, some of which contributes
    to situational awareness. Situational awareness refers to a state of understanding
    the “big picture” in time- and safety-critical situations. The more situational
    awareness people have, the better equipped they are to make informed decisions.
    Given that hundreds of millions of Twitter communications (known as “tweets”)
    are sent every day and emergency events regularly occur, automated methods are
    needed to identify those tweets that contain actionable, tactical information.
    The purpose of this dissertation is to explore how Twitter is used in mass emergencies,
    and to inform mechanisms for automatically identifying information that contributes
    to situational awareness. \nThis dissertation provides a three-part analysis of
    Twitter communications from four different mass emergency situations. I first
    perform discourse analysis on tweet content to uncover and explain the information
    Twitter users communicate during mass emergencies. This analysis serves as the
    basis for a qualitative coding scheme of specific information types that lead
    to situational awareness. Second, using this coding scheme, tweets from each of
    the four emergency events are coded by multiple annotators and inter-annotator
    agreement rates are calculated. The results of this process provide an overview
    of the information Twitter users contribute in these emergency situations. My
    final analysis identifies linguistic characteristics of those tweets that convey
    situational awareness information and serves as a foundation for natural language
    processing classifiers that can be trained to identify such tweets. \nIn sum,
    this dissertation contributes (1) an analysis of tweet content that is relevant
    to situational awareness, (2) an overview of the information Twitter users communicate
    that contributes to situational awareness, and (3) a computational linguistic
    resource for the development of natural language processing tools that automatically
    extract tweets containing information relevant to situational awareness."

  category: Computational Linguistics
  abstract: "Displacement of pets in and after disaster events is a serious matter
    to families and creates public safety and health issues at large. During and after
    Hurricane Katrina, an estimated 200,000 pets were displaced from their guardians,
    with only five percent of these pets ever being reunited with their guardians.
    One of the major obstacles to successful pet-to-family reunification is the large
    search space individuals must navigate in search of lost pets. Grounded in the
    theory of crisis informatics, which studies how people use information communication
    technology (ICT) in crisis, this work leverages the phenomenon of digital volunteerism
    to better address the problem of pet-to-family reunification. \nThis effort culminates
    in the form of No Place Like Home, which is an online platform for use by digital
    volunteers interesting in aiding pet-to-family reunification efforts in a disaster.
    This work describes this system in terms of its design features and software architecture.
    The primary design features of the system are an accessible user interface, collaboration
    mechanisms (in the form of social network support and chat rooms), and social
    capital. The other key feature of this system is how it incorporates human computation
    (performed by the crowd of digital volunteers) with machine computation (performed
    by information retrieval and classification systems) in a collaborative manner
    which plays to the strengths of each type of computation. \nAn evaluation of the
    machine learning components of the system in an experimental setting reveals that
    the positioning of machine computation as supporting the larger activities of
    digital volunteers is promising. With this validation, the system is poised for
    future public deployment in a disaster scenario and further study."

    If we extrapolate to what such behavior means for the future, we argue that information
    management under emergency conditions will need to become increasingly socially
    distributed. A natural point of contention in such a view is the matter of how
    to assess the quality of information: how “good” or “bad” it is; whether it is
    “misinformation” or “disinformation.”  Borrowing from Simon’s satisficing, we
    consider the matter of the assessment of information helpfulness and credibility
    as a function of the “everyday analytic” skills that people use to take action
    during mass emergencies. We discuss steps in a research agenda for the development

  abstract: "Unprecedented uses of information and communication technology (ICT)
    and particularly social media (e.g., Wikipedia, Facebook, and Twitter) are occurring
    in times of crisis. This dissertation investigates the socio-technical practices
    emerging from the use of social media and how these practices help to sustain
    the living heritage of historic crises. The purpose is to provide empirical evidence
    on how heritage is a living and participatory phenomenon that needs to be considered
    when designing technology for heritage matters. The concepts of grassroots heritage
    and socially-distributed curation are offered as a way of interpreting heritage
    in the context of the participatory culture. \nThis dissertation presents a multi-method
    investigation to determine what crisis narratives appeared in social media and
    how social media were used to sustain these narratives through curatorial activities.
    The first study surveys the social media presence of 111 crisis events that occurred
    between 1960 and 2010 to examine if and how past historically significant crisis
    events were being commemorated in the present day through new media. Then, ethnographic
    and automated collection methods were used to identify narratives appearing in
    the social media landscape for four crisis events that exhibited a high social
    media presence in the survey. The dissertation presents five meta-narratives for
    two crisis cases: (1) the 1984 Bhopal gas leak and (2) the 2001 September 11 attacks.
    One critical finding is that people sustain the heritage of historic crises in
    the digital world by perpetually revising narratives while adapting these messages
    to the new media of today. The second study critiques both the concept of “curator”
    as a profession as well as the concept of “curation” that is emerging from the
    social web to develop an initial conceptual model of curation. The final study
    involved the application and assessment of this initial conceptual model by analyzing
    the curatorial activities that produced the crisis narratives found in the first
    study. From this assessment, I articulate a theoretical model called socially-distributed
    curation to inform the design of future social technology."

    from four different crisis events of varying nature and magnitude and built a
    classifier to automatically detect messages that may contribute to situational
    awareness, utilizing a combination of hand- annotated and automatically-extracted
    linguistic features. Our system was able to achieve over 80% accuracy on categorizing
    tweets that contribute to situational awareness. Additionally, we show that a
    classifier developed for a specific emergency event performs well on similar events.
    The results are promising, and have the potential to aid the general public in
    culling and analyzing information communicated during times of mass emergency.

  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: 'The role Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) play in enabling
    people to coordinate efforts in providing aid and assistance during disasters,
    like hurricanes and earthquakes, has emerged as an active research topic, as people
    can now participate in the recovery effort globally. The majority of these studies,
    however, have focused on the acute emergency phase during and shortly after a
    disaster strikes. It is still unclear what role ICTs, like Facebook, can serve
    during ongoing disruption as caused by violent conflict, and this dissertation
    attempts to address that gap. When people experience war, they are living under
    constant threats, such as bombings and militia attacks. Thus, it may be difficult
    for people to engage in emergency related behaviors, as well as maintain their
    daily routines. Two main problems may further limit people’s ability to act in
    such contexts: (1) the degradation of societal trust and (2) increased distance,
    thus resulting in the breakdown of trust of not only the government, but of their
    community. Additionally, support networks are disrupted and many people may flee
    a war zone to seek safety in another location. Likewise, it may be difficult to
    travel safely and easily due to ongoing violence. In order to better understand
    how ICTs enable people to act when experiencing ongoing disruption, we used a
    combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to longitudinally
    study the Iraqi population. We conducted 90 semi-structured interviews in both
    English and Arabic with Iraqis who had been experiencing the current Gulf War
    since March 2003. We also designed and deployed an online survey to better understand
    people’s friendship formation behavior and Facebook use. Additionally, we collected
    archival materials like news articles and blog data, which we used to further
    inform our analysis. We found that Iraqis were using ICTs to engage in emergency
    related behaviors as part of the disaster recovery process, as well as to be resilient
    in maintaining and developing new routines. Firstly, Iraqi civilians used ICTs
    to manage their public identity, to develop collaborative practices that relied
    on those with whom interpersonal trust previously existed, and to conduct background
    checks. These new practices, in turn, enabled people to maintain and develop new
    routines for work, social life, and public discourse, to be able to obtain trustworthy
    jobs and services, and to continue interacting with others in public. Secondly,
    ICTs mediated the development of unofficial, trust-based social arrangements through
    which people then resolved continual breakdowns in the infrastructures supporting
    travel, education, and information. Thirdly, Iraqi civilians are now using Facebook
    to engage in emergency related behaviors, to maintain integral cultural practices,
    and to engage in new activities to improve their country. We then discuss how
    Iraqi citizens were using ICTs to regain security, to rebuild their society, and
    to engage in activities that are beyond what are considered routine.'

  abstract: When societies experience disruption as caused by natural disasters, various

    engage in activities that aid in the recovery effort—the process that leads to

    be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated
    individuals that provide and resolve breakdowns in infrastructure. This paper
    reports on an ethnographic study of the use of ICTs by citizens experiencing ongoing
    disruption in a conflict zone. We conducted 86 interviews with Iraqi civilians
    who experienced the 2nd Gulf War beginning in March 2003. We show how citizens
    used ICTs to continuously resolve breakdowns in infrastructure during ongoing
    disruption caused by the conflict by creating new, reliable technology-mediated
    social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel,
    education and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure
    and implications for the disaster relief effort.

    We interviewed 65 Iraqi citizens who experienced the current Gulf War beginning

    institutions can erode. We find that trust is contextual–-as aspects of the physical
    world change, conceptions of trust can also change. We show how people were able
    to create a context of trust in the environment by using ICTs to manage their
    public identity, to conduct background checks, and to develop collaborative practices
    that relied on those with whom interpersonal trust previously existed. These new
    practices, in turn, enabled people to maintain work collaborations, to determine
    whether or not to continue interacting with others in public, to be able to travel
    safely, and to find trustworthy jobs. In developing these new practices we argue
    that technology enabled people to restore a sense of normalcy in an environment
    that had radically changed.

  abstract: This empirical study of “digital volunteers” in the aftermath of the January
    12, 2010 Haiti earthquake describes their behaviors and mechanisms of self-organizing
    in the information space of a microblogging environment, where collaborators were
    newly found and distributed across continents. The paper explores the motivations,
    resources, activities and products of digital volunteers. It describes how seemingly
    small features of the technical environment offered structure for self-organizing,
    while considering how the social-technical milieu enabled individual capacities
    and collective action. Using social theory about self organizing, the research
    offers insight about features of coordination within a setting of massive interaction.

  abstract: The blogosphere is changing how people experience war and conflict. We
    conducted an analysis of 125 blogs written by Iraqi citizens experiencing extreme
    disruption in their country. We used Hoffman’s [8] stages of recovery model to
    understand how blogs support people in a region where conflict is occurring. We
    found that blogs create a safe virtual environment where people could interact,
    free of the violence in the physical environment and of the strict social norms
    of their changing society in wartime. Second, blogs enable a large network of
    global support through their interactive and personal nature. Third, blogs enable
    people experiencing a conflict to engage in dialogue with people outside their
    borders to discuss their situation. We discuss how blogs enable people to collaboratively
    interpret conflict through communities of interest and discussion with those who
    comment. We discuss how technology can better support blog use in a global environment.

  abstract: Social media enables the creation of online communities across physical
    boundaries. Blogs,or weblogs, enablebloggers to interact with a range of followers.
    We sought to conduct a qualitative study of the nature of the interactions that
    emerge in a blog community whose members are experiencing the impacts of ongoing
    conflict. We chose the Iraqi blogging community as a case study and focused on
    investigating the role of intercultural interactions in shaping people’s experiences
    during conflict. We found that intercultural interactions aided people by providing
    support, finding commonality, building a knowledge base, and in giving advice
    on restoring infrastructure. The intercultural interactions provided alternative
    views of an event constructed from diverse cultural perspectives. We found that
    the intercultural interactions we observed suggest a degree of intercultural competency
    within the blogosphere.

  abstract: This paper considers a subset of the computer-mediated communication (CMC)
    that took place during the flooding of the Red River Valley in the US and Canada
    in March and April 2009. Focusing on the use of Twitter, a microblogging service,
    we identified mechanisms of information production, distribution, and organization.
    The Red River event resulted in a rapid generation of Twitter communications by
    numerous sources using a variety of communications forms, including autobiographical
    and mainstream media reporting, among other types. We examine the social life
    of microblogged information, identifying generative, synthetic, derivative and
    innovative properties that sustain the broader system of interaction. The landscape
    of Twitter is such that the production of new information is supported through
    derivative activities of directing, relaying, synthesizing, and redistributing,
    and is additionally complemented by socio-technical innovation. These activities
    comprise self-organization of information.

  abstract: "Crisis informatics is a new area of research that studies the use of
    technology in and around disaster events by members of the public. In particular,
    crisis informatics studies the digital behaviors of people accessing social media
    websites as they collectively generate, consume and disseminate information about
    a crisis or disaster event. A key challenge for crisis informatics researchers
    is capturing these activities, as the information can appear without warning and
    is often ephemeral. For instance, on the Twitter micro-blogging service, only
    the last 3200 status updates of a user are stored, older updates are simply deleted.
    Unfortunately, crisis informatics researchers have observed users who generate
    more than 3200 updates during a single event, increasing the importance of being
    able to capture their information while it is being generated. \nThis thesis examines
    the issues surrounding the design and development of a data collection mechanism
    for social media websites with the constraints of crisis informatics research
    in mind. The system is designed to capture data while it is being generated, storing
    it in a persistent database for later analysis. It is designed to scale to multiple
    machines to ensure that many websites can be monitored at once or to ensure that
    all the data being generated from a single website or service (such as Twitter)
    can be captured without loss.  \nWhile our data collection service provides a
    generic framework for searching social media websites, for the purposes of this
    thesis, we focused on building modules for searching Twitter. Our Twitter integration
    allows for two types of search, one based on keyword and one based on gathering
    the tweets of users who contributed to the result set of a keyword search. We
    call the latter search a contextual search as it grabs the tweets that surround
    the ones that match the given keyword search.\nOur data collection service provides
    search capabilities on top of the results that it retrieves, allowing crisis informatics
    researchers the ability to verify the accuracy of their search terms.\nThis system
    has seen production use in gathering data across a major disaster event that occurred
    in January of 2010. The data gathered by our service provided data sets with known
    collection-related parameters, allowing them to be useful for later empirical
    and ethnographic research activities by crisis informatics researchers."

  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: Long before the geospatial community got around to creating “mashups,”
    the concept of “composing” a new product by mashing different components was successfully
    used in such other domains as music. Map mashups entered the mainstream of cartography
    after Google introduced its public Google Maps API in 2005. Web 2.0 technology,
    which enables online social communication, mass collaboration, information sharing,
    and user-centered design, has made the creation and use of web mashups widespread.
    In this article, we explain why crisis map mashups are created and how they are
    often designed.1 As an example of how ubiquitous web mashups have evolved, we
    present a crisis mashup created in response to the 2010 Chile earthquake using
    the Ushahidi open source platform.

  abstract: In a networked world, we are increasingly inundated with information from
    online data streams especially from the social web. Curation has increasingly
    become the buzzword for managing this problem of information overload in the digital
    age. However, the applications and interpretations of curation by social web users
    are varied and often stray away from traditional curator roles. I present seven
    curatorial activities (i.e. collecting, organizing, preserving, filtering, crafting
    a story, displaying, and facilitating discussions) based on the analysis of 100
    web artifacts. I introduce the concept, socially-distributed curation, to emphasize
    the distributed nature of this curatorial process emerging from the social web.
    Lastly, I present seven case studies to illustrate preliminary examples of curated
    crisis content for four crises. These findings are to inform future designs and
    developments of crisis management tools that could benefit from curated crisis
    content.

  category: Sociobehavioral Research
  abstract: We examine microblogged information generated during two different co-occurring
    natural hazards events in Spring 2009. Due to its rapid and widespread adoption,
    microblogging in emergency response is a place for serious consideration and experimentation
    for future application. Because microblogging is comprised of a set of practices
    shaped by a number of forces, it is important to measure and describe the diffuse,
    multi-party information exchange behaviors to anticipate how emergency governance
    might best play a role. Here we direct consideration toward information propagation
    properties in the Twitterverse, describing features of information redistribution
    related to the retweet (RT @) convention. Our analysis shows that during an emergency,
    for tweets authored by local users and tweets that contain emergency-related search
    terms, retweets are more likely than non-retweets to be about the event. We note
    that users are more likely to retweet information originally distributed through
    Twitter accounts run by media, especially the local media, and traditional service
    organizations. Comparing local users to the broader audience, we also find that
    tweet-based information redistribution is different for those who are local to
    an emergency event.

  category: Perspectives and Vision
  abstract: The exchange of information during times of crisis/disaster has traditionally
    been the purview of public safety, the National Guard and other local, state or
    federal authorities.  However, this model is undergoing a change with the availability
    of new mobile communications capabilities and the rise of social networking sites.  The
    general public can now create and share information about crises as they unfold,
    and researchers have documented the timeliness and surprising accuracy of this
    information.  As part of a large National Science Foundation funded project, researchers
    at the University of Colorado are developing tools to extract, organize and assess
    the flow of crisis related information as posted on social networking sites.  With
    the promise of improved warning and coordination, such tools should help reduce
    the impacts of large-scale disruptions, including political crises, natural disasters,
    pandemics and terrorist threats.  In this model, members of the public can obtain
    (and produce) information about an emergency that is specialized to their needs—as
    well as meta-information specialized for crisis situations— that helps them make
    judgments about the ever-growing amount of information.  Such meta-information
    includes features of its source; judgments about the authoritativeness of the
    source; its concurrence (or not) with official sources; its timeliness (as the
    information may be better than official sources); other spatio-temporal features
    of the information’s life; and anticipation of who would be looking for this information
    and why. Data mining and information extraction techniques have a critical place
    here, as does the creation of trust models and security techniques to offer privacy
    or possibly anonymity. <br>However, if mechanisms are provided to enhance the
    users' privacy and even offer the capability for anonymous information contributions,
    it is possible that malicious entities may exploit this anonymity and inject false
    and misleading information into information streams. It is worth noting that false
    information could be introduced into the system without these features; it is
    just that an anonymizing system removes the consequence of being identified.  Fundamentally,
    establishing identity within a networked environment is a challenging problem.  For
    instance, a classic problem within the field of reputation systems is the Sybil
    attack, which occurs when a single entity establishes a large number of identities,
    for instance, by adding a large number of nodes to a peer-to-peer network.  This
    has implications on designing reputation systems to detect the injection of bad
    information by malicious parties, since it is always possible for them to simply
    add a new identity to the system to counteract any previous misbehavior.  Given
    this fact, we take an alternate approach to determining reputable users and information
    during an event.  We will look at two possible implicit reputation indicators,
    one using client location services and another using analysis methods based on
    network graphs and activity within networks.  Using network analysis methods,
    it may be possible to infer location, influence and other attributes based on
    communication, context and association with others in the network.  Data for these
    methods is available via public application programming interfaces (APIs) from
    some online social networks.  Monitoring these public APIs during crisis situations,
    we are able to use these analysis methods to infer information about users as
    the crisis is evolving.<br>With the development of these tools, we must consider
    public policy issues that arise from this research.  First, we ask what public
    policy issues emerge as a result of this vision of empirical research and development
    activities, and how they can be framed using a crisis informatics lens? Investigations
    of this kind require consideration about how crisis-related data is collected,
    analyzed and disseminated within the context of current federal and state laws,
    policies and regulations.  Because information aggregation efforts may cross national
    borders, we will also take into account similar (and often more stringent) laws
    and policies in other countries.  Important questions in this area center on issues
    of legal precedent, communications-related laws and policies, regulations and
    authorities regarding information dissemination during disasters and privacy and
    security issues.  Other questions include how the policy context will affect our
    own information capture and aggregation methods.  As an over-arching concern,
    we question whether it will be possible to design methods for capturing and processing
    diverse content ethically and in adherence of law, while also not creating new,
    insurmountable policy issues around information aggregation.  Next, we ask what
    is the risk of legal liabilities that might arise.  Who is responsible if the
    information is wrong?  What if the system suppresses the dissemination of vital
    information?  Does this constitute some type of negligence or a failure to adhere
    to required duty?

    place in the physical world, trust in people, information, and institutions can
    change – in this sense, trust is contextual. We then offer recommendations for
    designing new technologies for people who experience disruption, taking into account
    trust and context.

  abstract: We present a vision of the future of emergency management that better
    supports inclusion of activities and information from members of the public during
    disasters and mass emergency events. Such a vision relies on integration of multiple
    subfields of computer science, and a commitment to an understanding of the domain
    of application. It supports the hopes of a grid/cyberinfrastructure-enabled future
    that makes use of social software. However, in contrast to how emergency management
    is often understood, it aims to push beyond the idea of monitoring on-line activity,
    and instead focuses on an understudied but critical aspect of mass emergency response—the
    needs and roles of members of the public. By viewing the citizenry as a powerful,
    self-organizing, and collectively intelligent force, information and communication
    technology can play a transformational role in crisis. Critical topics for research
    and development include an understanding of the quantity and quality of information
    (and its continuous change) produced through computer-mediated communication during
    emergencies; mechanisms for ensuring trustworthiness and security of information;
    mechanisms for aligning informal and formal sources of information; and new applications
    of information extraction techniques.

  abstract: On-line websites and applications are increasingly playing a role in disaster
    response and recovery. Yet with the wide variety of on-line grassroots activities
    that occur in such situations, it can be difficult to make sense of them. In this
    paper, we describe on-line behavior as socially convergent activity, interpreting
    it within existing sociological understandings of behavior in disaster events.
    We discuss seven types of convergent behavior and give examples of on-line activities
    for each type. By seeing these activities as an essential part of the disaster
    social arena, we can begin to think about how to support socially convergent phenomena
    in new and creative ways.

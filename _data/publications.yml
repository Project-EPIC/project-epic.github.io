  title: Working & Sustaining the Virtual “Disaster Desk”
  abstract: Humanity Road is a volunteer organization working within the domain of
    disaster response. The organization is entirely virtual, relying on ICT to both
    organize and execute its work of helping to inform the public on how to survive
    after disaster events. This paper follows the trajectory of Humanity Road from
    an emergent group to a formal non-profit, considering how its articulation, conduct
    and products of work together express its identity and purpose, which include
    aspirations of relating to and changing the larger ecosystem of emergency response.
    Through excerpts of its communications, we consider how the organization makes
    changes in order to sustain itself in rapid-response work supported in large part
    by episodic influxes of volunteers. This case enlightens discussion about technology-supported
    civic participation, and the means by which dedicated long-term commitment to
    the civic sphere is mobilized.

  title: ! 'MySQL to NoSQL: Data Modeling Challenges in Supporting Scalability'
  abstract: Software systems today seldom reside as isolated systems confined to generating
    and consuming their own data. Col- lecting, integrating and storing large amounts
    of data from disparate sources has become a need for many software engineers,
    as well as for scientists in research settings. This paper presents the lessons
    learned when transitioning a large-scale data collection infrastructure from a
    relational database to a hybrid persistence architecture that makes use of both
    relational and NoSQL technologies. Our examples are drawn from the software infrastructure
    we built to collect, store, and analyze vast numbers of status updates from the
    Twitter micro-blogging service in support of a large interdisciplinary group performing
    research in the area of crisis informatics. We present both the software architecture
    and data modeling challenges that we encountered dur- ing the transition as well
    as the benefits we gained having migrated to the hybrid persistence architecture.

  title: ! 'No Place Like Home: Pet-to-Family Reunification after Disaster'
  abstract: Pets are important household members, and their welfare and safety are
    imperative to the emotional welfare of the family. Displacement of pets after
    disaster events is a serious matter to families and for public safety at large.
    People are not willing to evacuate without their non-human family members; many
    will break through evacuation zones to recover animals left behind. In the 2005
    Hurricane Katrina event, over 200,000 pets were displaced, and 95% of them were
    never reunited with their families. The US Department of Agriculture confirms
    that the problem of reuniting displaced pets and their guardians at this scale
    is unfortunately common in disaster events. We introduce No Place Like Home, a
    socially networked web and mobile platform that facilitates reunification of non-human
    with human family members following disaster events. No Place Like Home is an
    effort that supports the formation of small cadres of micro-tasking &#8216;digital
    volunteers&#8217; that converge after disasters to do photo- and description-matching;
    employs a reputation and reward system to encourage use; and uses match-based
    machine learning techniques to accelerate the manual matching tasks performed
    by digital volunteers.

  title: ! 'The Evolving Role of the Public Information Officer: An Examination of
    Social Media in Emergency Management'
  abstract: This work examines how the introduction of social media has affected the
    role of the Public Information Officer (PIO)—the public relations component of
    the National Incident Management System (NIMS). Through analysis of 25 PIO interviews,
    we examine the work practice of PIOs and find that social media expand not only
    the scope and type of PIO work activity, but also the “information pathways” that
    exist between PIOs, the media, and members of the public. We model these changes
    and examine how the presence of social media challenges previous conceptualizations
    of PIO work. Lastly, we present a view of how PIO work could be better imagined
    for the future of emergency management organizations.

  title: Foundations of a Multilayer Annotation Framework for Twitter Communications
    During Crisis Events.
  abstract: In times of mass emergency, vast amounts of data are generated via computer-mediated
    communication (CMC) that are difficult to manually collect and organize into a
    coherent picture. Yet valuable information is broadcast, and can provide useful
    insight into time and safety-critical situations if captured and analyzed efficiently
    and effectively. We describe a natural language processing component of the EPIC
    (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) Project infrastructure, designed
    to extract linguistic and behavioral information from tweet text to aid in the
    task of information integration. The system incorporates linguistic annotation,
    in the form of Named Entity Tagging, as well as behavioral annotations to capture
    tweets contributing to situational awareness and analyze the information type
    of the tweet content. We show classification results and describe future integration
    of these classifiers in the larger EPIC infrastructure.

  title: Blogs as a Collective War Diary.
  abstract: Disaster-related research in human-centered computing has typically focused
    on the shorter-term, emergency period of a disaster event, whereas effects of
    some crises are longterm, lasting years. Social media archived on the Internet
    provides researchers the opportunity to examine societal reactions to a disaster
    over time. In this paper we examine how blogs written during a protracted conflict
    might reflect a collective view of the event. The sheer amount of data originating
    from the Internet about a significant event poses a challenge to researchers;
    we employ topic modeling and pronoun analysis as methods to analyze such large-scale
    data. First, we discovered that blog war topics temporally tracked the actual,
    measurable violence in the society suggesting that blog content can be an indicator
    of the health or state of the affected population. We also found that people exhibited
    a collective identity when they blogged about war, as evidenced by a higher use
    of first person plural pronouns compared to blogging on other topics. Blogging
    about daily life decreased as violence in the society increased; when violence
    waned, there was a resurgence of daily life topics, potentially illustrating how
    a society returns to normalcy.

  title: ! '‘Facebooking’ Towards Crisis Recovery and Beyond: Disruption as an Opportunity'
  abstract: This paper reports on an ethnographic study of Facebook use amongst a
    population living through ongoing disruption. We interviewed 45 Iraqi citizens,
    as well as received survey responses from 218 individuals, who have been experiencing
    the current Gulf War since March 2003. We show how people in a society experiencing
    conflict use Facebook in ways that are different to uses in non-war societies.
    We find that Facebook supports people living in crisis environments at two levels.
    First, Facebook aids people directly to recover from disruption. People used Facebook
    to create “safe lists”, to seek help and provide assistance, and to re-construct
    their social scaffolding. But at a deeper level, citizens also used Facebook to
    maintain and develop new social norms, and to re-direct their country. We discuss
    how disruption can serve as an opportunity by which people can re-invent their
    societies and how our understandings of Facebook should evolve.

  title: ! 'The Egyptian blogosphere: a counter-narrative of the revolution.'
  abstract: In this paper we investigate the role blogs played within the context
    of the Egyptian revolution of early 2011 using blog data authored between 2004-2011.  We
    conducted topic modeling analysis to gain a longitudinal view of the interaction
    of societal, personal and revolutionary blog topics over this period. Furthermore,
    a qualitative  analysis of blog posts during the period that bracketed the political
    uprising revealed Egyptian bloggers’ concerns. Reporting events and supplying
    commentary provided bloggers with a means to voice dissent against  institutionalized
    power represented by  the  government-controlled media. In short, blogs reveal
    a counter-narrative to the government-supplied version of events in Egypt during
    the  18-day uprising. These narratives offer rich documentation of how blogs,
    and perhaps social media more generally, can be utilized by individuals operating
    under repressive conditions.

  description: The design and development of data-intensive software systems-systems
    that generate, collect, store, process, analyze, query, and visualize large sets
    of data-is fraught with significant challenges both technical and social. Project
    EPIC has been designing and developing these systems in support of crisis informatics
    research since fall 2009. Anderson's experience working on Project EPIC has provided
    insight into these challenges. In this talk, Anderson will share their experience
    working in this design space and describe the choices they made in tackling these
    challenges and their attendant trade-offs. He will highlight the lack of developer
    support tools for data-intensive systems; the importance of multidisciplinary
    teams; the use of highly-iterative life cycles; the need for deep understanding
    of the frameworks and technologies used in data intensive systems; how simple
    operations transform into significant challenges at scale; and the paramount significance
    of data modeling in producing systems that are scalable, robust, and efficient.

  description: Crisis informatics addresses socio-technical concerns in large-scale
    emergency response. Additionally it expands consideration to include not only
    official responders (who tend to be the focus in policy and technology-focused
    matters), but also members of the public. It therefore views emergency response
    as a much broader socio-technical system where information is disseminated within
    and between official and public channels and entities. Crisis informatics wrestles
    with methodological concerns as it strives to develop new theory and support informed
    development of ICT and policy. Palen will describe the range of work her team
    has engaged in at CU-Boulder since 2006, and highlight the different branches
    of crisis informatics research through discussion of the multidisciplinary research
    they have conducted here.
